          I definitely feel like <a href="http://uiowa.edu">I've learned a thing or two today</a>. And <a href="http://iastate.edu">I'm definitely enjoying all of it too</a>, understanding it pretty well. So that's good.

          I'm not currently sure how continuing with these classes will fit in with my current schedule, but hopefully something can be worked out. I have time to think about it and figure it out though, so that's good.
